# resume / Blind CV

in lieu of a resume, I have opted to do something similar here that is needed in my company.  we need a web-based "blind" CV mechanism that auto-populates to promote candidates we are working with. As it stands now, a recruiter has to do this manually within Adobe Acrobat which is time intensive when promoting a candidate to a given potential hiring entity. 

This will eventually tie to our database to reflect an amount of active candidate information accurately but also with some section(s) modified at random to reflect materially similar but not identical information; precise listing of all aspects can be tied to a given physician identity thus failing to conceal their identity which is a problem since most physicians seeking a new role do so before telling their current employer.
