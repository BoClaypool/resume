                    <p class="about-me-contents">
                        I would like to find a largely child adolescent position on an inpatient basis, though some amount of outpatient work 
                        would be fine and long-term sustainable as well.  I am also willing to see an amount of adult patients, provided the 
                        preponderance of work I do is with children.  Telepsychiatry is an interest of mine and I would like to gain further 
                        experience with telepractice overall, but I would not want it as a significant portion of my professional focus.  I 
                        am open to medical directorships and feel confident in my supervisory capacity.  While I have financial goals for myself
                        and a family, which means I have to seek a position that is decently financially competitive, money is not my primary 
                        motivation; finding a positive, collegial environment where evidence-based, compassionate care is valued above all 
                        else is my primary goal.  I am open to both permanent and interim/locums opportunities.
